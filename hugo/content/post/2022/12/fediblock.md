I have undertaken a small project today to revamp our list of sites that we prohibit federation with.
Our previous list was extensive but also contained some false positives that I've removed on request from a few members.
It also contained many domains which no longer exist, which makes continued maintenance cumbersome.

We don't expect users to notice any significant difference in the type of content visible while using the instance, but should something arise that is not consistent with our Server Rules and values, please use the reporting function to make the moderation team aware.

Any visitors or registered members can view the list of limited/suspended domains from [vmst.io/about](https://vmst.io/about) under "Moderated servers".

Domains are classified inline with our core [Rules](https://docs.vmst.io/rules/) as:

- Harassment
- Impersonation
- Bigotry
- Extremism
- Malicious (or SPAM)
- Sexual Violence (or Gore)
- Disinformation

Additionally, domains related to Cryptocurrency are limited but no longer suspended.

While many of the suspended domains could be classified under multiple combinations of the categories, only one is listed.
