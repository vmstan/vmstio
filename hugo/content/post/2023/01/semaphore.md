Semaphore is an [open source project](https://github.com/NickColley/semaphore) to build an alternative web frontend for Mastodon.
It is a continuation of the Pinafore project that was recently sunset.

I have decided to stand up an instance of Semaphore at [semaphore.vmst.io](https://semaphore.vmst.io) for our users to play with.
(You don't technically have to be a vmst.io member to use it.)

A few disclaimers:
- I consider this (to grab a VMware term) a "Fling" and not part of our core services offering, at least for the time being.
- If it breaks, it could be me or it could be the upstream developers. While you're free to let me know directly if there are issues as it relates to availability, if it's a bug in the product or something you'd like done differently please leave a comment on their [GitHub](https://github.com/NickColley/semaphore/issues).
- This is not and will never be a replacement for the main web interface on [vmst.io](https://vmst.io), it's just a another option (along side [Elk](https://elk.vmst.io)) for folks to use and help test.

Lastly, the ability to do these things is funded by our members, so if you'd like me to be able to stand up additional "Flings" for other tools or platforms please visit our [Funding](https://docs.vmst.io/funding) page and sign up to be a monthly contributor.
