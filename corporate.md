# Corporate/Brand Account Policy

**Corporate or brand accounts are currently not permitted on vmst•io.**

We encourage you to be yourself on vmst•io. 

If you apply for an account on vmst•io for a business, brand or other organization, it will be rejected. If you use your personal account simply as a proxy for such groups in violation of or _"No advertising, spam or excessive promotion"_ rule, then you may be asked to move your account to another instance.

While we consider adaptations to this policy, if you are interested in hosting your brand account on vmst•io, then you will need to reach out directly to Michael Stanclift. You can DM or email him directly at `vmstan@vmst.io`.
