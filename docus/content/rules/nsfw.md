# NSFW

No sexually explicit or graphically violent media.

## Sexual Content

Inspired by the [Hachyderm Community Guidelines](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/nsfw-policy/), our views on this topic are as such:

- We want vmst.io to be a home for science, technology, and collaboration while also embracing the beauty and depth of all walks of life.
- Modern society functions with deep-rooted and historical sexual norms that are exploitative, unfair, harmful towards marginalized people, where the danger for these individuals is often overlooked.
- Product marketing, sales tactics, and even corporate policies are often structured and allow for harmful culture to thrive, often in the name of hetero-normative traditions and expectations.
- Many parts of the industry operate with a bias towards keeping traditional and hetero-normative sexual culture protected while demonizing sex work, kink culture, queer culture, polyamory, ethical non-monogamy, furry, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, transgender, or any other sexual area of what we refer to as “The Alphabet”.
- We deeply believe in validating, legitimizing, and confirming many sexually marginalized cultures on our platform. We understand that silencing sexual content is typically used as a weapon to target gender minorities and sexual minorities.

We ask that users refrain from posting sexually explicit or pornographic content using their vmst.io accounts.
While the definition of what is considered pornographic might differ from region to region, this is generally understood to be content that would be considered pornographic for users in the United States and Canada where our instance is based.

Absolutely under no circumstance is 18+ content allowed without a content warning.
Sexual content which violates consent is expressly prohibited.

## Federated Content

Users are **not** generally prohibited from following accounts from other instances that post explicit content, even if we do not permit posting it locally.
As a result explicit content may show up on the Federated timeline where it’s viewable by all members.

Moderators will make an effort to issue limitations to remote accounts who regularly post explicit content.
Limiting the account will enable those who directly follow the account to continue accessing it, while preventing its visibility on the Federated timeline.

If local accounts are deemed to be following such content in an attempt to “poison” the federated timeline, those accounts should be suspended after consultation with an Administrator.

## CSAM

The use of your account to view CSAM (child sexual abuse materials) including CG-CSAM (computer generated) or other fictionalized sexualized media (lolicon) is expressly prohibited and will result in an immediate account suspension, removal of content, and reporting to the appropriate law enforcement officials.

This includes content posted locally or viewed through a federated instance. In the event you inadvertently observe content through our system of this nature, we expect it to be reported to our staff immediately.
