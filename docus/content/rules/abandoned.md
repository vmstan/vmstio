# Abandoned Accounts

In order to keep the number of junk accounts on vmst.io as low as possible, we have an review process for account creation that includes a number of manual and automated processes:

- User e-mail verification
- User hCaptcha verification
- Automated IP blocklist checks
- Manual moderator account approval

Accounts that are created, but then do not complete e-mail/hCaptcha confirmation within three days are automatically deleted.
Additionally, accounts that complete moderator approval but are then abandoned, are subject to deletion after 30 days.

Approved accounts which have any pattern of usage during this period, as defined below, will generally not be considered abanonded:

- Setting profile data such as an avatar or biography information
- Performing any customization of account settings
- Adding multi-factor authentication to an account
- Logging into the account from another device other than the one used to activate it
- Re-authenticating at least once from the original device that created the account
- Posting, boosting, or replying to any other status

You also have the ability to delete your own account at any time.
