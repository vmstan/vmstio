# Abandoned Accounts

In order to keep the number of junk accounts on vmst•io as low as possible, we utilize a review process for account creation that includes both manual and automated processes:

|       **Method**      | **Automatic** | **Manual** |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------|
| Email verification    |       ✔       |            |
| hCaptcha verification |       ✔       |            |
| IP blocklist check    |       ✔       |            |
| Moderator approval    |               |      ✔     |

Requests for accounts that do not complete e-mail and [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) verification within three days are automatically deleted.

**Unused moderator-approved accounts are subject to deletion after 30 days.**

## Preserve an Account

Complete any of the following actions at least once for a moderator-approved account to confirm the account is not abandoned:

- [Set profile information](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/), such as by adding an avatar or filling out biography information.
- Perform any customization of [account settings](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/preferences/).
- Add [multi-factor authentication](https://fedi.tips/using-two-factor-authentication-2fa-on-mastodon/) to an account.
- Log into the account from a device other than the device used to create the account.
- Re-authenticate at least once from the device used to create the account (for example, sign out and sign back in).
- Add a post, boost a post, or reply to any post.

You also have the ability to [move](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#migration) or [delete](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#delete) your own account at any time.
