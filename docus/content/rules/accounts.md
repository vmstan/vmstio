# New Accounts and Approvals

In order to keep the number of junk accounts on vmst•io as low as possible, we utilize a review process for account creation that includes both manual and automated processes:

|       **Method**      | **Automatic** | **Manual** |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------|
| Email verification    |       ✔       |            |
| hCaptcha verification |       ✔       |            |
| IP blocklist check    |       ✔       |            |
| Moderator approval    |               |      ✔     |

New accounts that do not complete e-mail and [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) verification within three days are automatically deleted.

## Moderator Approval

All new accounts are subject to moderator/administrator review and may be flagged for additional verification if required.

## Preserve an Account

We generally want all accounts on vmst.io to be active at some point. Complete any of the following actions at least once for a moderator-approved account to confirm the account is not abandoned:

- [Set profile information](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/), such as by adding an avatar or filling out biography information.
- Add [multi-factor authentication](https://fedi.tips/using-two-factor-authentication-2fa-on-mastodon/) to an account.
- Add a post, boost a post, or reply to any post.

You also have the ability to [move](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#migration) or [delete](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#delete) your own account at any time.

Accounts that are created but show no activity within the first 30 days are subject to deletion.
