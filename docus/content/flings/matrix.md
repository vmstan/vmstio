# Matrix

[Matrix](https://matrix.org) is an open network for secure, decentralized communication.
Matrix lets you do realtime messaging in 1:1 sessions or in groups, with end to end encryption.

You can use a variety of different clients to login to Matrix. If you're familiar with Matrix you can grab your [client of choice](https://www.matrix.org/clients/). Element is a great client option for multiple desktop platforms, Android and iOS.

To make things even easier, we run our own Element client at [element.vmst.io](https://element.vmst.io).

## Logging In

The first time you login you'll need to establish your Matrix account, your vmst.io username may automatically populate, but needs to stay the same as your Mastodon username for consistency. Your "homeserver" will be **matrix.vmst.io** and when you login you'll use your Mastodon credentials, so there's no second set of passwords to manage.

You can now talk to anyone else on the Matrix platform, not just other vmst.io users who have activated their accounts!

::alert{type="info"}
Your Matrix handle will be as **@username:vmst.io** for sharing with other users to help in finding you on the network.

After you've logged in, you can also join `#general:vmst.io` and chat with other vmst.io users.
