# Semaphore

Semaphore is an [open source project](https://github.com/NickColley/semaphore) to build an alternative web frontend for Mastodon.
It is a continuation of the Pinafore project that was recently sunset.

We have decided to stand up an instance of Semaphore at [semaphore.vmst.io](https://semaphore.vmst.io) for our users to play with.

You don't have to be a vmst.io member to use our Semaphore instance.
