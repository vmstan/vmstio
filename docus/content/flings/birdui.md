# Bird UI

Bird UI is an alternative theme for the main Mastodon web interface.

Unlike [Elk](/flings/elk), Bird UI is done all with CSS theming, and provides an interface similar to what you might find from legacy Birdsites.
The code for Bird UI is maintained by [Roni Laukkarinen](https://vmst.io/@rolle@mementomori.social) and is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/mastodon-bird-ui).

To enable Bird UI on your vmst.io account, visit Preferences > [Appearance](https://vmst.io/settings/preferences/appearance) > Site Theme > Bird UI.

This will work with the default single-column or Advanced multi-column layout options.
There are also High Contrast and Light color theme options available.

To disable Bird UI, simply select one of the default Mastodon themes from the same control panel option.
