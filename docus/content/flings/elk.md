# Elk

Elk is an alternative way to access your Mastodon account from your browser.

Through the Mastodon API, Elk provides similar access to posts and actions on posts you expect to be able to do to Mastodon.
You can compose a post (Toot, if you like), boost others' toots, like, bookmark, and scroll just as you would through your regular server site.

Why Elk, then?
Elk provides some features not available through the standard Mastodon web app interface.

- Notifications for the same post combine when they are sequential. No more seeing your same viral joke multiple times in the Notification feed for each like and boost. Now you can see it just one, with a list of who liked or boosted the post just above the post itself.
- You control whether you see boost, like, and follower accounts - all separately!
- See a preview of the profile when someone follows you.

You can use Elk right in your browser.
