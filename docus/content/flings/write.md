# Write

Due to the generous nature of the [folks that are contributors](https://docs.vmst.io/funding) to vmst.io, we now have our own instance of WriteFreely.

:button-link[Launch WriteFreely]{icon="simple-icons:markdown" href="https://write.vmst.io" blank}

WriteFreely is free and open source software for easily publishing writing that may be longer than the 500 character limit on Mastodon.

Users can follow and boost your posts on write.vmst.io just like your regular Mastodon account, because it uses ActivityPub.

::alert{type="info"}
The ActivtyPub format of your WriteFreely account will be `@username@write.vmst.io`
::

You can boost your own long form writing from your Mastodon account. Best of all you login to write.vmst.io using your primary vmst.io Mastodon account, so there's no second set of passwords to manage. When you set two factor authentication on your Mastodon account, it carries over to write.vmst.io.

When you create your write.vmst.io Blog, it'll ask you to set your display name, this is like the name of your blog. It can be your real name, or whatever you'd like to call your blog. Your username will automatically populate, and should stay the same as your Mastodon username for consistency.

::alert{type="info"}
Your regular posts will be accessible from will be `https://write.vmst.io/username`
::

WriteFreely uses Markdown. For more information on how to use the platform, check out their [User Guide](https://writefreely.org/docs/latest/writer).
