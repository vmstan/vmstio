# Translation API

We use the free tier of [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) as a translation API for our Mastodon Web client interface.
Since the translation feature is not used extensively on [vmst.io](https://vmst.io), we do not plan to go beyond the free tier and begin paying for a different tier, or stand up our own self-hosted translation API, but will evaluate this again in the future should the need arise.
