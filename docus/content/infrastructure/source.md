# Source Code

Our goal is to provide the best possible Mastodon experience for our members.
One way to deliver on that is by delivering the most up-to-date Mastodon code.
We  "run off main", which means using the latest commits to the `main` branch of the Mastodon codebase found on the project's official [GitHub](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) repository.

We take a clean copy of the latest Mastodon code and then apply a limited set of modification with a custom script.
We then build the modified code inside a Docker container, publish it to GitHub and Docker Hub, for consumption by our Kubernetes cluster.

Mastodon instance specific customizations include:

- Customizing the Mastodon logo, if needed, for events like Pride Month ([SVG](https://cdn.vmst.io/docs/masto-pride.zip))
- Removing the Hiredis driver ([vmstan/mastodon #2](https://github.com/vmstan/mastodon/pull/2))
- Raising the post character count limit from 500 to 512 ([vmstan/mastodon #1](https://github.com/vmstan/mastodon/pull/1))
- Changing the icon used for "Unlisted" posts ([mastodon/mastodon #26678](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/26678))
- Making images in the timeline views draggable ([mastodon/mastodon #26656](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/26656))
- Adding an S3 retry option ([vmstan/mastodon #3](https://github.com/vmstan/mastodon/pull/3))
- Adding a link to Warning Presets in the admin interface ([mastodon/mastodon #26199](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/26199))
- Adding the [Elephant](/flings/elephant) and [Tangerine](/flings/tangerine) themes ([vmstan/mastodon #6](https://github.com/vmstan/mastodon/pull/6))
- Adding the GitHub commit to the [version information](/infrastructure/versions)

Container specific build settings include:

- Using Docker 12 "Bookworm" with the latest package updates as our container base operating system
- Enabling [YJIT](https://shopify.engineering/ruby-yjit-is-production-ready) for better Ruby performance
- Performance optimizations for Jemalloc.

We intend to upstream these changes with the adoption of PR [mastodon/mastodon #26850](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/26850) to the Mastodon project, or a similar concept.

## Container Availability

Our customized container image is available from both Docker and GitHub container registries.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/users/vmstan/packages/container/package/mastodon)
- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/vmstan/mastodon)

## Streaming Container

Our default container removes Node.js and is not able to run the Mastodon Streaming API, but we have a customized container image specific to this task which is stripped down and based on Debian, available from both Docker and GitHub container registries.

## Redis TLS Changes

Digital Ocean requires encrypted/TLS connections to their managed Redis instances, however the Mastodon codebase uses a Redis driver ([hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis-rb)) which does not have a native TLS capability.
To accommodate this, we have in the past used [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org) or [Stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org) to take the un-encrypted connection requests and encrypt those connections between the Mastodon components and Redis.

We have chosen to remove the hiredis driver from our installation and use redis-rb instead.
Using the native redis-rb driver provides support for TLS connections.
This is done by patching a stock Mastodon installation with the following commands, downloading updated bundles and node components, and recompiling:

```bash
sed -i '/gem '\''hiredis'\'', '\''~> 0.6'\''/d' ./Gemfile
sed -i '/hiredis/d' ./Gemfile.lock
sed -i '/hiredis/d' ./lib/mastodon/redis_config.rb
sed -i '/hiredis/d' ./lib/tasks/mastodon.rake
sed -i 's/, driver: :hiredis//g' ./app/lib/redis_configuration.rb
sed -i 's/, require: \['\''redis'\'', '\''redis\/connection\/hiredis'\''\]//' ./Gemfile
```

Compared to running with hiredis through HAProxy or Stunnel, we have not seen any negative impact in performance by using redis-rb.
