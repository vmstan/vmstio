title: Relays
---

vmst.io does not currently run a Fediverse relay, but we participate in the following systems:

- relay.infosec.exchange
- relay.universeodon.com
- relay.publicsquare.global

Relays allow all content from participating instances to be directly federated to everyone else, without waiting for a direct user connection to be established.
This helps with content discovery and more to complete conversation threads and hashtags for our users.
