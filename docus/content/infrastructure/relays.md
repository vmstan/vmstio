# Relays

Relays allow all content from participating instances to be directly federated to everyone else, without waiting for a direct user connection to be established.
This helps with content discovery and more to complete conversation threads and hashtags for our users.

Federation and content discovery still happen without relays, but relays create an express lane between instances who participate.

## Relays Participation

vmst.io participate in the following relay systems:

- [relay.universeodon.com](https://relay.universeodon.com)
- [relay.infosec.exchange](https://relay.infosec.exchange)
- [relay.publicsquare.global](https://relay.publicsquare.global)
- [rel.re](https://rel.re)
- [mastodon-relay.thedoodleproject.net](https://mastodon-relay.thedoodleproject.net)
- [bigrelay.social](https://bigrelay.social)

## Major Relayed Instances

Through participation in relays, these instances (and many more) are accessible in the Federated timeline for vmst.io users.
_This list is representative and subject to change at any time due to circumstances outside of vmst.io administrator control._

- mastodon.social
- mastodon.online
- mastodon.world
- mstdn.social
- infosec.exchange
- universeodon.com
- me.dm

These instances represent some of the biggest and most vibrant in the Fediverse.
vmst.io members get the best of being on a highly available and powerful backend, with careful moderation, and still don't have to miss out on being part of the wider community.
