# Relays

vmst.io does not currently run a Fediverse relay, but we participate in the following systems:

- relay.infosec.exchange
- relay.universeodon.com
- relay.publicsquare.global

Relays allow all content from participating instances to be directly federated to everyone else, without waiting for a direct user connection to be established.
This helps with content discovery and more to complete conversation threads and hashtags for our users.

Federation and content discovery still happens without relays, but they create an express-lane between instances who participate.

## Relayed Instances

Through participation in relays, these instances (and many more) are accessible in the Federated timeline for vmst.io users.
_This list is subject to change at anytime due to circumstances outside of vmst.io administrators control._

- mastodon.social
- mastodon.online
- mstdn.social
- masto.ai
- infosec.exchange
- me.dm
- flipboard.social
- toot.community
- moth.social
- mastodonapp.uk
- techhub.social
- cupoftea.social
- phpc.social
- wx.social

These instances represent some of the biggest and most vibrant in the Fediverse.
vmst.io members get the best of being on a highly available and powerful backend, with careful moderation, and still don't have to miss out on being part of the wider community.
