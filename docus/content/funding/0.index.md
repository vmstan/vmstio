# Funding

Running a full featured, highly available and very performant Mastodon instance [costs money](/funding/costs). We don't have investors, run ads, or sell your data.
vmst·io is funded by the membership of the instance.
Without you, we don't exist.

While access to your account does not require a paid subscription, if you desire to help cover the cost of running vmst·io, we have multiple options available:

Monthly subscriptions can be managed through Ko-Fi.

Yearly subscriptions can be managed through Open Collective.

Legacy monthly subscriptions can be managed through Patreon.
