# Funding

Running a full featured, highly available and performant Mastodon instance [costs money](/funding/costs). We don't have investors, run ads, or sell your data.
vmst·io is funded by the membership of the instance.
Without you, we don't exist.

While access to your account does not require a paid subscription, but for those that can afford it we have options to help cover the cost of running vmst·io:

Monthly subscriptions can be managed through Ko-Fi.

Yearly subscriptions can be managed through Open Collective.

Legacy monthly subscriptions can be managed through Patreon.

You can also make one-time contributions using either Ko-Fi or Open Collective.

## Merch

We have some stylish merchandise available through Cotton Bureau, featuring our "Toots In / Toots Out" logo.
T-shirts, sweatshirts and tank tops, starting at $25.

### Contribution Benefits

Everyone who helps fund our operations gets their first contribution posted by our [@funding](https://vmst.io/@funding) bot.

* Those who sign up for Blue or Purple tiers will be included in a monthly shoutout post by <a rel="me" href="https://vmst.io/@vmstan">@vmstan</a>.
* Purple and above are listed on a [dedicated page here](/funding/purple).

Members who provide financial support are still subject to the same [rules of the road](/rules) that all members must follow.

The real difference between the tiers is how much you feel your usage of the platform is worth.
