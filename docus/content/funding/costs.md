## Expenses

At the moment all of our staff are volunteers, and our only expenses are monthly bills to our various server providers.

Money is set aside to cover any tax expenses, or unforeseen costs.
Additional funds have also been used to make donations to other projects such as Mastodon, Elk and Matrix.
We also periodically test different service offerings to decide if their long term use would be a good fit, but later discontinue their use.
