# Cost Overview

## Income

The majority of our income comes from monthly subscriptions through [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/vmstio) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vmstan), while a small number of members elected to subscribe annually through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/vmstio).
Annual subscriptions are represented [here](/funding/costs#expenses) in the monthly total.

Any other funding that comes through one-time tips or shop purchases are also represented below.

|---------------|----------------|
| Subscriptions | $426 per month |
| Tips & Merch  | $1298 total    |

Numbers reflect raw donation numbers in USD, not reflective of Patreon or Stripe fees and/or exchange rates.

## Expenses

At the moment all of our staff are volunteers, and our only expenses are monthly bills to our various server providers.

| **Vendor**    | **Monthly** |
|---------------|-------------|
| Digital Ocean | $513        |
| Grafana Labs  | $29         |
| AWS           | $1          |

Money is set aside to cover any tax expenses, or unforeseen costs.
Additional funds have also been used to make donations to open source software projects that we use, such as Mastodon and Elk.

We also periodically test different service offerings to decide if their long term use would be a good fit.
After a period of review and testing, we may discontinue such offerings if they do not contribute to the community as shown by use.
