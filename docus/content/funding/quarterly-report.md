# Quarterly Report

## The Situation

The situation is good.
We have 85 patrons who have given to help keep vmst.io sustainable.
Two of those contributors have actually been administrators of other instances, that we've helped or inspired.

The instance went online on October 6, 2022.
I did not open up for registration until October 26, and it was sometime later that I began taking contributions on Patreon.
There were expenses paid to Masto Host, but then a large bit of our initial expenses in moving to Digital Ocean were cut by a $200 credit.

There were also a couple of larger expenses that I took while one-time donations were coming in, like extending our domain registration by three years (.io domains are not very cheap) and purchasing our commercial wildcard certificate for this year.

As of February 6, 2023

- **Total Income:** $ 1,424.21
- **Total Expenses:** $ (987.28)
- **Remaining Balance:** $ 436.93

As such I only have reliable data for the full months of December and January in terms of what to expect for regular income and expenses.

| Month | Income | Expenses |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **December** | $639.98 | -$305.47 |
| **January** | $532.53 | -$207.32 |

I like having a cushion, especially because our bills are typically loaded on the front-end of the month where as our Patreon and Stripe payments come in through the rest of the month.

There is also some unknowns in that both months were heavy in one-time and yearly contributions, which I don't expect to continue to be the case every month.

For instance, our month to date finances are as such:

| Month | Income | Expenses |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **February** | $238.71 | -$391.31 |

But this will balance out as monthly subscriber payments via Stripe come in.

## Ledger

I've decided to publish the [Ledger](/funding/ledger) of all income and expenses to-date, including our current balance.
This will be regularly updated.
It's always available [here](/funding/ledger).

## Contributing

I have updated our [Costs](/funding/costs) page with information on the fees that our various payment systems use.
The TLDR of that is Patreon is the most expensive option.
It also currently makes up half of our monthly contributors.

Our Ko-Fi and Open Collective options provide much lower rates, and more control.
While we're not asking anyone to stop contributing through Patreon, or move to another system, I have decided to temporarily pause new subscriptions there.

When I plan for what I can build in terms of our [Infrastructure](/infrastructure) I do this based mostly on what comes in from monthly subscribers.

## Future

I have mentioned in a couple of toots that I'm investigating a not for profit organization to become the "owner" of vmst.io for the long term.
While I have nothing to report on this front at this time, I'm open to discussions with folks who have experience in this area.

Please reach out if you feel you can be of assistance.
