# Covenant+

The Mastodon Server Covenant serves as a foundation for instances seeking inclusion on Join Mastodon, offering a set of minimum standards. However, we recognize the need for a higher level of distinction, professionalism, and guaranteed service within the Mastodon community. To address this, we propose Covenant+, an additional tier that goes beyond the baseline requirements.

Covenant+ builds on this by requiring the following:

- All C+ members must be current members of the standard Join Mastodon Server Covenant for a minimum of six months.
- All C+ members must publish a strict code of conduct that reflect a commitment to inclusiveness, respect, and tolerance, explicitly addressing issues such as discrimination, harassment, hate speech, and other forms of harmful behavior.
- All C+ members must provide full account portability support (within the limits of the latest Mastodon software) between other C+ instances.
- All C+ members must commit to performing updates to the latest released version of Mastodon (or its forks) within 72 hours.
- All C+ members must submit to periodic peer-review by fellow administrators, evaluating their infrastructure life cycle and verifying backup processes.
- All C+ members must publish real-time system status (via a third-party monitoring tool) and strive to maintain better than 99.9% uptime over any 90-day period.
- All C+ members must participate in a Relay with other C+ member instances.
- All C+ members must maintain a transparent and accountable moderation system, ensuring fair and consistent enforcement of community guidelines and prompt response to user reports.
- All C+ members must actively contribute to the Mastodon community by participating in discussions, providing support to other instance administrators, engaging in collaborative initiatives,  reporting bugs, suggesting feature enhancements, and engaging in beta testing programs.

The original Server Covenant commitment to providing 3 months of advanced notice before shutting down is amended to allow another C+ member to take over the instance. The new instance owner can then either run the instance indefinitely or commit to providing up to 6 months to migrate user accounts.
