Your social media feed should be filled with <strong>what matters to you most</strong>, not what a corporation thinks you should see. Mastodon is radically different social media, back in the hands of the people. Mastodon treats you like <strong>a person, not a product</strong>.<br>
<br>
No tracking. No advertising.
<h3>This Patreon funds the continued operation of the Mastodon instance&nbsp;<a href="https://vmst.io">vmst.io</a> administered by <a rel="me" href="https://vmst.io/@vmstan">@vmstan</a>.</h3>
But Mastodon isnâ€™t just the&nbsp;
<a href="https://vmst.io">vmst.io</a> domain, or a single a websiteâ€”<strong>it is a federation</strong>â€”think Star Trek. ðŸ–– Nearly <strong>4,000 independent communities</strong> (and growing) running Mastodon form a coherent network, where while <strong>every instance is different</strong>, each <strong>one is part of the whole</strong>. Mastodon is built on open standards, using <strong>sustainable technologies</strong>&nbsp;(i.e. no blockchain) that have powered the web for decades. <br>
<br>
Thanks to the network's spread out and independent nature there are 
<strong>more moderators </strong>who you can approach for personal help, and <strong>servers with strict codes of conduct</strong>. It also has tools to help you manage your usage, limit notifications, and <strong>control your experience</strong>.&nbsp;Mastodon comes with <strong>effective anti-abuse tools</strong> to help protect yourself.<br>
<br>
Mastodon is also part of a larger system of ActivityPub powered sites that can all interact together. There are 
<strong>millions of users</strong> across nearly 9,000 ActivityPub powered sites. Some like Mastodon, some more like other video and picture sharing social media sites you're used to on the Internet. But <strong>without lock-in</strong>, without making you the product. <br>
<br>
You can even use ActivityPub to power commenting and interacting to posts from on your own blog!
