We love our Custom Emoji here at vmstÂ·io.
A complete list of all the available options and their `:short_codes:` is [available via Emojos.in](https://emojos.in/vmst.io)

## Including an emoji in your profile name

If you find one you'd like to include in your username field, just copy and paste the short code into the username field in your profile page.

## Requesting a new emoji

If we're missing an emoji you just love from another instance, or from your favorite Slack, just ask us to add them.
