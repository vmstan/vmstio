We're happy to announce the launch of [docs·vmst·io](https://docs.vmst.io)!

This site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and like much of the rest of our infrastructure, is running on Digital Ocean in their static site platform. The theme is minimalist, uncomplicated.

The the main goal is to centralize the knowledge about running the vmst·io Mastodon instance. This is for our users, but maybe even other instance admins who want to see how we're doing things?

How do I find things? [Search](/search).

A few pages to highlight:

- [Funding](/funding)
- [Brands & Corporate Accounts](/brands)
- [Server Covenant](/covenant)
- [Custom Emoji](/emoji)
- [Mail Rules](/mailer)
- [Status Monitoring](/monitoring)
- [Instance Rules](/rules)
- [Staff](/staff)
- [Trends](/trends)
- [Your Account](/you)

We hope that this site can be used to help new users find their way on vmst·io, but also across the rest of the Fediverse.
