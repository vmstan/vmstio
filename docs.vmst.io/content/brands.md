We encourage you to be yourself on vmst·io.

But not every account on social media is a person, although there area usually people behind them.
Centralized platforms require all different types of accounts to be in the same place.
Decentralized platforms like Mastodon offer an opportunity for each instance to set policies on the types of accounts that they allow.
It also allows brands and corporations to host their own social media presence, independent of other companies.

Any accounts that are not identified as personal, 

## Corporate Accounts

Corporate brand accounts are currently not permitted on vmst·io

We feel that brands and companies should be setting up their own instances under domains they're identified with and control.
This not only benefits the brands in terms of verifying that their accounts are self-verified, but helps users control their interactions with those brands.

## Groups & Associations

If you are an "on-topic" non-profit organization, community group of or other association (for example, say you run "Kansas City Information Technology Professionals") we may permit your account. If you are unsure if you qualify please contact [@vmstan@vmst.io](https://vmst.io/@vmstan).

## Open Source Projects

If you are the maintainer of an free open source project, and want to maintain an account distinct from your personal account, you may be permitted to do so. If you are unsure if you qualify please contact [@vmstan@vmst.io](https://vmst.io/@vmstan).

## Bot Accounts

While bot accounts are not strictly prohibited, they are discouraged on vmst.io, unless they provide some clear purpose or value to either the vmst.io community or wider Fediverse.

We have a couple of internal bots, for example one that post whenever someone signs up as a recurring patron of vmst.io.

Bot accounts that repost content from other social networks or sites, without the consent of the content owners, are prohibited.

## Development Accounts

If you are the developer of an Mastodon/ActivityPub client (either open/closed soruce) or other Fediverse project and would like to use an account on vmst.io to test the functionality of your application, please contact [@vmstan@vmst.io](https://vmst.io/@vmstan) before doing so.
While we are generally supportive of such things we like to know ahead of time should it cause disruptions in service to other members.
