## Corporate or brand accounts are currently not permitted on vmst·io

We encourage you to be yourself on vmst·io.

If you apply for an account on vmst·io for a business, brand or other for-profit organization, it will be rejected.
If you use your personal account simply as a proxy for such groups in violation of our _"No advertising, spam, or excessive promotion"_ [rule](https://vmst.io/about), then you may be asked to move your account to another instance.

We feel that brands and companies should be setting up their own instances under domains they're identified with and control. This not only benefits the brands in terms of verifying that their accounts are self-verified, but helps users control their interactions with those brands.

If you are a non-profit organization, or other association, we may permit your account. If you are unsure if you qualify please contact [@vmstan@vmst.io](https://vmst.io/@vmstan).
