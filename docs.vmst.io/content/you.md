## Why do you want to be _here_?

When you apply for an account on vmst·io, we ask you to provide a reason why you want to join.
**We take this seriously.**
Tell us a bit about yourself, what brings you here, and what your interests are.
It doesn't have to be formal, just enough to make us excited to welcome you to our community.

## Moving Away

You may close your account or move it to another instance at any time.
You may also [redirect users from your profile](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#migration) here to your identity on your new instance.
You are in control of your identity and your social graph* on Mastodon (and other federated instances), but the administrators here control your ability to use this instance and to interact with its users.

* Your social graph is who you follow and who follows you.

## Backing up your data

In addition to regular backups we make of our infrastructure, you can backup your data and [export it](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#export) at any time.
You can also [delete your account](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#delete) and your data at anytime.
You can even [schedule regular deletions](https://vmst.io/statuses_cleanup) of previous posts, if that's your thing.

## Data Security

Unless it's required of us to investigate a reported instance of abuse of our policies, under standard operation we have no ability to regularly access your direct messages with other members of our platform.
While this data is accessible with a request to our hosting providers database systems, we expect that to not be necessary except under extreme circumstances.
Where possible, we will notify you if such processes are taken for data associated by your account.

However, due in part to the open and federated nature of Mastodon instances, the Mastodon administrators of other instances you interact with may have access to your data.

While the connection to this site is encrypted, this is only the data in transit to you and to other servers in the federated network.
**The messages and data stored in the instance is not encrypted.**
This includes direct messages sent to other users of vmst·io!

This is not a choice of the administrator, but a limitation of the Mastodon platform.
Additionally, our hosting provider may have access to your data as part of the general administration of the server infrastructure.

You should use Signal, Matrix, or another E2E messaging app for the things you really want to be private.
