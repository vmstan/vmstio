We have decided to periodically publish a high level summary of moderator actions on vmst.io.
These statistics are cumulative starting when the instance opened on October 6, 2022.

Future updates are planned quarterly.

_These numbers were last updated on February 17, 2023._

## Summary

Local users are vmst.io members.
Remote users are members of federated instances.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Unique Reporting Events** | **45** |
| Local Users vs Local Users | 6 |
| Local Users vs Remote Users | 29 |
| Remote Users vs Local Users | 10 |

_Unique Reporting Events_ are defined as an single report or a group of reports against a single user, during a specific time period, up to the point an action is taken.
If a subsequent report is made, this is treated as a new Unique Reporting Event.

## Account Actions

For a full definition of the various Moderator actions, please review our [Moderator Policy](/moderation).

### Suspensions

Local accounts that are suspended lose all access to their account.
Their account profile and posts also become inaccessible to any other user.

Remote suspended accounts lose their ability to interact with any members of vmst.io.
Any relationships between all vmst.io members and the remote user are broken.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Accounts Suspended** | **16** |
| Local Accounts | 5 |
| Remote Accounts | 11 |

### Limitations

Limited accounts lose the ability to interact with other users when they do not already have a relationship, or are connected through direct interaction. Their content is no longer visible on the Local or Federated timelines.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Accounts Limited** | **6** |
| Local Accounts | 3 |
| Remote Accounts | 3 |

### Freezing

Frozen accounts cannot post but their previous content is still accessible.

|---|---|
| **Accounts Frozen** | **1** |

Only local accounts can be frozen.

### Appeals

Account limitations or suspensions can be appealed to a Director and/or Administrator.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Appeals Attempted** | **2** |
| Appeals Accepted | 2 |
| Appeals Rejected | 0 |

Only local accounts may appeal moderator decisions against them.

## No Actions

After careful review we may determine that no action is required on a report.

| Local Users vs Remote Users | 10 |
| Remote Users vs Local Users | 6 |

## Content Actions

On some reports action is taken directly on the reported content, but not on the reported user account.

| | |
|---|---|
| Content Limited | 4 |
| Content Removed | 1 |

Limiting to Removing content are the only options available.
Other than marking images as sensitive our Moderators cannot directly edit member posts.
