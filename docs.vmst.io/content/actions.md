We have decided to periodically regularly publish a high level summary of moderator actions on vmst.io.
These statistics are currently cumulative since the instance came online, on October 6, 2022.

_These numbers were last updated on February 17, 2023._

## Summary

| **Unique Reporting Events** | **45** |
| Local Users vs Local Users | 6 |
| Local Users vs Remote Users | 29 |
| Remote Users vs Local Users | 10 |

_Unique Reporting Events_ are defined as an single report **or** a group of multiple reports against a single user, during narrow time period.
So for example, if a user's post generates two different user reports (regardless of their source) this is treated as a single event because there is one, unified action, that is taken by our moderator team.

After a unique report is resolved, and then a subsequent report is made related to a different event, requiring additional moderator action, this is treated as a separate and unique event.
