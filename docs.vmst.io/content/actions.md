We periodically publish a high level summary of moderator actions on vmst.io.
These statistics are cumulative starting from when the instance opened on October 6, 2022.

Future updates are planned quarterly.

_These numbers were last updated on February 17, 2023._

## Definitions

- **Local users** are vmst.io members.
- **Remote users** are members of federated instances other than vmst.io.
- **Unique Reporting Events** are a single report **or** group of reports against a single user or post, during a specific time period.

  We distinguish a new unique reporting event as:
  - A new report after resolving a previous reporting event
    
    For example, three reports on the same user are the same reporting event.
    Moderators take action, resolving the three reports.
  
    Another user then reports the same user.
    This new report is a separate unique reporting event.
  
  - Reports require additional or different moderator action
  
    For example, two different reports against the same user.
    One report resolves with no action while the other report resolves with limiting the reported user.
    These are two separate unique reporting events.
  
  **Note:** While multiple reports are grouped in this page into reporting events, the moderation team takes multiple reports against a user very seriously.
  Report count against a user or post reflect the urgency of needed action.

When reviewing reports, moderators may take

* [Actions against an account as a whole](#account-actions)
* [Actions against specific content or posts](#content-actions)
* [No actions against either the account or content](#no-actions)
