## Rule Violations

If you find content that is in violation of the Server Rules, please [report the offending account](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/#report).
You may also [take other actions](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/) on your own, such as muting or blocking the account, or the entire domain/instance.

### Defederation

We actively "defederate" vmstÂ·io from other instances that are incompatible with our fundamental rules, in an effort to protect our users.
The decision to defederate can come from reports by our users but is also based on community discussion around such bad actors.
We would rather be proactive in blocking bad actors versus waiting for abuse to happen.

### Reporting an instance for Fediblocking

If during your use of the platform, you find another instance that you think needs to be restricted from interacting with ours **or** if you feel that another instance may have been blocked by our staff in error, please file an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/vmstan/mastodon/issues/new/choose).
If you'd feel more comfortable, you can also reach out to one or more of our staff directly via direct message.

## Our Discretion

We want to foster an open discussion where **everyone** feels welcome.
The rules are meant to be clear and direct, but the staff of this instance has ultimate discretion on how they are enforced.
We may alter to these rules as needed, but will make an effort to notify you of any major change.

If you are found to be in violation, the staff may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the instance.

## Following Norms

There are certain "norms" of Mastodon, and the wider "Fediverse" that you'll be expected to follow while a member of this instance.

For example, include [content warnings](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw) when necessary, mark media as [sensitive](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw) as appropriate, and regularly use [descriptive text](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#edit) (or "Alt Text") for image uploads.

Some of these norms may be different than what you're used to on other platforms.
While failure to use these these are not strictly moderation worth events, we do ask that you respect and try and conform to these norms as you explore and grow on the platform.
