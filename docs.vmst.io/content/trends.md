## Where's the Algorithm?

One of the key features of Mastodon is there's no sophisticated algorithm to drive more traffic to the site, or influence your thinking.

Mastodon does offer hashtag, post, and link [trending features](https://vmst.io/explore) that are based solely on observed activity within vmstÂ·io and other federated instances.

## What trends?

Hashtags largely trend on their own without moderator intervention, but can be removed if they are abusive or disruptive.
Some links will trend automatically if they're from mainstream or other sources known to be reputable.

## Trending Moderation

Some posts will trend automatically if they're from known figures with a history of appropriate content.
Other trends are manually approved by our staff, and only removed if they are deemed inappropriate.
