Due to the generous nature of the [folks that are contributors](https://docs.vmst.io/funding) to vmst.io, we now offer Matrix as a benefit for members. Matrix is an open network for secure, decentralized communication. Matrix lets you chat in real time in 1:1 sessions or in groups, with end to end encryption.

While it doesn't use ActivityPub it does use WebFinger to communicate server to server, just like Mastodon. You can use a variety of different clients to login to Matrix. If you're familiar with Matrix you can grab your [client of choice](https://www.matrix.org/clients/) (we suggest starting with [Element](https://element.io)) and login.

Your "homeserver" will be matrix.vmst.io, and when you login you'll use your Mastodon credentials, so there's no second set of passwords to manage. When you set two factor authentication on your Mastodon account, it carries over to Matrix. (Notice a theme here?)

The first time you login you'll need to establish your Matrix account, your vmst.io username may automatically populate, but needs to stay the same as your Mastodon username for consistency.

You can now talk to anyone else on the Matrix platform, not just other vmst.io users who have activated their accounts.

Your Matrix username will be as @_username_:vmst.io, very similar to a Mastodon username.

You can also join the `#general:vmst.io` and chat with other vmst.io users.
