<h2>Expectations</h2>

<h3>Rule Violations</h3>

<p>If you find content that is in violation of these rules please report the account using the "…" button and then "Report." If you are found to be engaging in harassing behavior, the moderator may take any action they deem appropriate, such as a warning or an expulsion from the server.</p>

<p>In addition we actively "de-federate" from other instances that violate these fundamental rules in an effort to protect our users. That list of blocked instances is available to registered members. If you feel that another instance may have been blocked by us in error, please reach out to our staff.</p>

<h3>Server Covenant</h3>
Although this instance is not currently listed on <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">joinmastodon.org</a> we are a party to the <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/covenant">Mastodon Server Covenant</a> which outlines the fundamental expectations for instance administration. This includes things like active moderation, daily backups, multiple staff members, and a commitment to provide notice to changes in the status of this instance.

<h3>Following Norms</h3>
<p> There are certain “norms” of Mastodon and the wider fediverse that you’ll be expected by other folks to follow. This includes things like the use of content warnings and descriptive text for image uploads. Some of these may be different than what you’re used to on other platforms. While these are not strictly moderation worth events, we ask that you respect and try and conform to them as you learn and grow on the platform.</p>

<h3>Our Discretion</h3>
<p>We want to foster an open discussion where <b>everyone</b> feels welcome. The rules are meant to be clear and direct, but the moderators and administrators of this instance have ultimate discretion on how they are enforced. We may alter to these rules as needed, and will make an effort to notify you of any major change.</p>

<h2>Your Account</h2>
<p>You may your close account or move it to another instance at any time. You are in control of your identity and your social graph on Mastodon (and other federated instances) but the administrators here control your ability to use this instance and ultimately to interact with its users.</p>

<p>In addition to regular backups we make of our infrastructure, you can backup your data and export it at any time. You can also delete your account and your data at anytime. You can even schedule regular deletions of previous posts, if that’s your thing.</p>

<h3>Your Privacy</h3>

<p>What will we do with your data? Nothing. How will you be influenced by advertisers? You won't. How will we aggregate your data in order to improve your service… we don't.</p>

<p>We will never share your data with anyone else, except in the case of valid legal requests if it comes to that. Similarly, users and third parties are forbidden from scraping content from the instance's web interface or API.</p>

<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>Unless it's required of us to investigate a reported instance of abuse of our policies, under standard operation we have no ability to regularly access your direct messages with other members of our platform. While this data is accessible with a request to our hosting providers database systems, we expect that to not be necessary except under extreme circumstances. Where possible we will notify you if such processes are taken for data associated by your account.</p>

<p>However, due in part to the open and federated nature of Mastodon instances, the Mastodon administrators of other instances you interact with may have access to your data.</p>

<p>While the connection to this site is encrypted, this is only the data in transit to you and to other servers in the federated network. <em>The messages and data stored in the instance is not encrypted.</em> This includes direct messages sent to other users of this instance! This is not a choice of the administrator, but a limitation of the Mastodon platform. Additionally, our hosting provider may have access to your data as part of the general administration of the server infrastructure.</p> 

<p>You should use Signal, Matrix, or another E2E messaging app for the things you really want to be private.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>It's not required to pay for access to your account, but if you feel obliged to help cover the cost of hosting this instance, please visit our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/vmstan">Patreon page</a> to do your part. In an attempt to be as transparent as possible the current cost structure and target towards meeting monthly funding goals are outlined there.</p>

<p>If we exceed the minimum goal then additional funding will be used to increase capacity, or to make periodic donations to Mastodon gGmbH and other groups supporting development of the platform.</p>
